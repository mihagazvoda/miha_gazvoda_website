The goal of this post introduce you t

# Plan: 

* how it relates to my previous post
* introduction to conjugate priors
* more about beta

* a simple example with beta

```{r}
source("functions.R")
prop_model(c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE))
```


* why would you prefer bayesian over standard testing



> First of all, interpretability is everything. Would you rather say "P(A > B) is 10%", or "Assuming the null hypothesis that A and B are equal is true, the probability that we would see a result this extreme in A vs B is equal to 3%"?`

* repeated testing?



* some tool to play around with betas

* play around with priors
